Release HOWTO
=============

An overly painful process for releasing:

  1) Green?  https://app.circleci.com/projects/github/RhysU/sourpuss
  2) Use `git tag -l` to determine which tag comes next
  3) In NEWS.txt, add date/revisions under a new section matching that tag.
  4) Commit NEWS.txt
  5) Create a new annotated git tag and push it with `git push origin --tags`
  6) Make sure that tag went green on Circle-CI
  7) Entirely remove the dist/ folder to avoid stake wheels
  8) Build a wheel following the steps listed in .circleci/config.yml
  9) Install twine with `python -m pip install twine`
